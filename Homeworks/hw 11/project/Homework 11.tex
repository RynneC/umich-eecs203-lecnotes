\subsection* {\probnum Bayes Easy [12 points]}

Suppose that one person in 10,000 people has a rare genetic disease. There is an excellent test for the disease; 99.9\% of people with the disease test positive and only 0.02\% who do not have the disease test positive.

\begin{qparts}
    \item What is the probability that someone who tests positive has the genetic disease?
    \item What is the probability that someone who tests negative does not have the disease?
\end{qparts}

\subsection*{\probnum Spaced Out [12 points]}
A space probe heading to Mars sends messages back to Earth using bit strings. Suppose that it sends a `1' one-third of the time and a `0' two-thirds of the time. However, the communication channel is noisy---when a 1 is sent, it is possible that noise interferes, causing Earth to receive a 0 and vise versa. Probabilities of different situations are listed: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item When a 0 is sent, the probability that it is received correctly is 0.6.
    \item When a 0 is sent, the probability that it is received incorrectly (as a 1) is 0.4.
    \item When a 1 is sent, the probability that it is received correctly is 0.8.
    \item When a 1 is sent, the probability that it is received incorrectly (as a 0) is 0.2.
\end{itemize}
\begin{qparts}
    \item Suppose Earth received a `0'.  What is the probability that the probe sent `0'?
    \item The space probe then transmits the same bit as part (a) again, and Earth receives `0' a second time. What is the probability the probe sent a 0? You can assume that the event of a bit getting corrupted is independent of any other bit getting corrupted.
\end{qparts}

\subsection*{Previous Groupwork 10(1): Lily's Lily Pads [15 points]}
Lily the Frog is on a lily pad and wants to get to her home! She can jump from lily pad to lily pad to help reach this goal. The lily pads are arranged in a grid. Lily starts on the \textbf{bottom-left} lily pad, and her home is at the \textbf{top-right} lily pad. Lily can only move one lily pad \textbf{upward} or one lily pad \textbf{rightward} at a time.\\

Each lily pad has coordinates of the form $(x, y) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$, where $x$ represents how far rightward a point is from the left of the grid, and $y$ represents how far upward a point is from the bottom of the grid. Lily starts at location $(0, 0)$, and her home is at location $(x_H, y_H)  \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$.\\

In the above example, $(x_H, y_H) = (3, 2)$. In the general case, though, $(x_H, y_H)$ could be any ordered pair of natural numbers.

\begin{qparts}
    \item How many different paths can Lily take to get home?
    \item Lily's frog friend, Francine, is also on the grid at coordinates $(x_F, y_F) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ such that $0 \leq x_F \leq x_H$ and $0 \leq y_F \leq y_H$. What is the probability that Lily meets Francine on her path home? You may assume that any two paths home are equally likely for Lily to take.

\subsection*{Previous Groupwork 10(2) Random Connections [15 points]}
We say that a \textit{random graph} is an undirected graph where, for each pair of vertices, there is an independent $\frac{1}{3}$ chance that they are adjacent. It's a bit like Lily's pond, except that the vertices aren't in a grid, and you can move in any direction.

We want to learn about the connectedness of random graphs.

Let $G$ be a finite random graph. Let's split the vertices into two nonempty sets, $A, B \subseteq V$.

\begin{qparts}
    \item Let $a \in A$. What is the probability that no element of $B$ is adjacent to $a$?
    \item What is the probability that there is some $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ such that $a$ is adjacent to $b$?
    \item Let's imagine doing this with larger and larger graphs. Define $f(a, b)$ be your answer to the previous problem when $|A| = a$ and $|B| = b$. What is
    \[ \lim_{a+b \to \infty} f(a,b)? \]
    \item This isn't quite a proof, but your answer to (c) might lead you to some ideas. What might you conjecture about the connectedness of infinite random graphs?

\subsection*{\probnum I Am Speed [10 points]}
Suppose we have two algorithms, $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$.  Suppose that on inputs of size $n$, algorithm $\mathcal A$ runs in time $\Theta(n^2)$, while algorithm $\mathcal B$ runs in time $\Theta(n^3)$. Show that there exists some $n_0$ such that for any $n > n_0$, algorithm $\mathcal A$ will take less time to run than algorithm $\mathcal B$ on inputs of size $n$.\\
\textbf{Note:} you may find it useful for your notation to let the runtime of $\mathcal A$ on inputs of size n be denoted as $f_{\mathcal A}(n)$, and similarly for algorithm $\mathcal B$ as $f_{\mathcal B}(n)$.

\subsection*{\probnum GameStop or GameRoll? [8 points]}
In a game of repeated die rolls, a player is allowed to roll a standard die up to $n$ times, where $n$ is determined prior to the start of the game. On any roll except the last, the player may choose to either keep that roll as their final score, or continue rolling in hopes of a higher roll later on. If the player rolls all $n$ times, then on the $n$-th roll the player must keep that roll as their final score. A player always acts to maximize their expected final score. Finally, let $V_n$ denote the final score in a game with a max of $n$ rolls allowed.
\begin{qparts}
    \item Compute $E(V_2)$ with justification.
    \item Compute $E(V_3)$ with justification.
    \item Find the smallest $n$ such that $E(V_n) \geq 5$.
