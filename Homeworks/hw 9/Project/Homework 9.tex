\subsection*{\probnum Melman the Graph [12 points]}
In a simple, undirected graph with $5$ vertices, what are all possible values for the number of vertices with odd degree? Justify your answer.

\subsection*{\probnum Keeping things Merry! [12 points]}

Mary has three dogs, Sarge, Duke, and Brady. However, when left alone, Duke will pick a fight with either of the other two dogs. Mary wants to walk all 3 dogs from her house across the road to the dog park, can only walk 1 dog at a time, and wants to avoid a fight between any of the dogs. She can make multiple trips across the road, and can leave some of her dogs on one side of the road when walking another across.

\begin{qparts}
    \item Draw a graph where the nodes are the legal configurations of the puzzle and the edges represent possible transitions from one state to another. Each node should contain M, S, D, B, and $||$ representing Mary, Sarge, Duke, Brady, and the road. For instance SB$||$MD would represent the Sarge and Brady being the the left side of the road at home with Mary and Duke on the other side at the park. Start with MSDB$||$ as your initial state.

    \item Identify the nodes that represent the start and end configurations of the puzzle. Is the puzzle solvable? Explain in terms of your graph.

\section*{Groupwork}
\subsection*{\probnum Grade Groupwork 8}
Using the solutions and Grading Guidelines, grade your Groupwork 8:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mark up your past groupwork and submit it with this one.
    \item Write whether your submission achieved each rubric item. If it didn't achieve one, say why not.
    \item Use the table below to calculate scores.
    \item For extra credit, write positive comment(s) about your work.
    \item You don't have to redo problems correctly, but it is recommended!
    \item What if my group changed? \begin{itemize}
        \item If your current group submitted the same groupwork last time, grade it together.
        \item  If not, grade your version, which means submitting this groupwork assignment separately. You may discuss grading together.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{\probnum Square the Cycle [15 points]}
Prove that every $n$-node graph ($n \ge 3$) in which all nodes have degree at least $\lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$ has a $3$-cycle subgraph or a $4$-cycle subgraph.

\textbf{Hint:} One useful concept is the neighborhood of a vertex; the neighborhood of $v\in V$ is the set $N(v)=\{u\in V : u\text{ is adjacent to }v\}.$ We can also define the neighborhood of a set $A\subseteq V$:
$$N(A)=\{u\in V : u\text{ is adjacent to some }v\in A\}.$$
We recommend using a proof by contradiction, although this can also be done with a clever direct proof. Suppose a graph satisfying the above condition does not have a 3-cycle or 4-cycle. Fix a vertex $v\in V.$ What can we say about the size of $N(v)$? What about $N(N(v))$?

\subsection*{\probnum The Office Allocation [15 points]}
Consider a new office building with $n$ floors and $k$ offices per floor in which you must assign $2nk$ people to work, each sharing an office with exactly one other person. Find a closed form solution for the number of ways there are to assign offices if from floor to floor the offices are distinguishable, but any two offices on a given floor are not.
